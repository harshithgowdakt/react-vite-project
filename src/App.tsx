        Bangalore ( BANG-gə-lor, LOR), officially Bengaluru (Kannada
        pronunciation: [beŋgɐɭuɾu] (listen)), is the capital and largest city of
        the southern Indian state of Karnataka. It has a population of more than
        8 million and a metropolitan population of around 11 million, making it
        the third most populous city and fifth most populous urban agglomeration
        in India, as well as second largest urban agglomeration in South India,
        and the 27th largest city in the world.[10] Located on the Deccan
        Plateau, at a height of over 900 m (3,000 ft) above sea level, Bangalore
        has a pleasant climate throughout the year, with its parks and green
        spaces earning it the reputation as the "Garden City" of India.[11] Its
        elevation is the highest among the major cities of India.[12] The city's
        history dates back to around 890 CE, as found in a stone inscription
        found at the Nageshwara Temple in Begur, Bangalore. In 1537 CE, Kempé
        Gowdā, a feudal ruler under the Vijayanagara Empire, established a mud
        fort, considered the foundation of modern Bangalore and its oldest
        areas, or pétés, which still exist. After the fall of the Vijayanagara
        Empire, Kempe Gowda declared independence; in 1638, a large Adil Shahi
        Bijapur army defeated Kempe Gowda III, and Bangalore was came under
        Shahaji Bhonsle as a jagir which later became his capital. The Mughals
        later captured Bangalore and sold it to Maharaja Devaraja Wodeyar II of
        the Kingdom of Mysore.[13] When Haider Ali seized control of the
        kingdom, the administration of Bangalore passed into his hands. The city
        was captured by the British East India Company after victory in the
        Fourth Anglo-Mysore War (1799), which then returned administrative
        control of the city, along with the kingdom, to Maharaja Krishnaraja
        Wadiyar III. The old city developed under the dominions of the maharaja.
        In 1809, the British shifted their cantonment to Bangalore, outside the
        old city, and a town grew up around it, which played as British
        residence in Mysore. Following India's independence in 1947, Bangalore
        became the capital of Mysore State, and remained the capital when the
        state was enlarged and unified in 1956 and after the state's renaming as
        Karnataka in 1973. The two urban settlements of Bangalore the town and
        the cantonmen which had developed as independent entities merged into a
        single urban centre in 1949. The existing Kannada name, Bengalūru, was
        declared the city's official name in 2006.
